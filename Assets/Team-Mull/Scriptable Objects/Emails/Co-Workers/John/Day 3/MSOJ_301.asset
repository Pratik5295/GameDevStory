  Message: "Hey! I have some good news for you, do you remember the other intern
    that came with you? He got terminated! Mannnnn I disliked him soo much, he acted
    like a know-it-all, he supported pay-to-play model when my battlepass design
    was perfect. Happy he\u2019s gone.\n\nLunch as 12? I made takoyaki."
