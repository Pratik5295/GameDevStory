    Description: 'Hello Young One!


      This will be your first challenge! Don''t
      worry, I shall make it very simple. Our concept artist has left you with a
      beautiful outline of an abstract asset that we will be using. You will have
      to drag and drop colours to fill the asset, use any colours you want! The only
      constraint will be that you shouldn''t use the same colour next to each other!'
