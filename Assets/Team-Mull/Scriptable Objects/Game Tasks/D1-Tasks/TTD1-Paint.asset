    Description: "Hello Young One!\n\nThis will be your first challenge! Don't worry,
      I shall make it very simple. Our concept artist has left you with a beautiful
      outline of an abstract asset that we will be using. \n\nYou will have to drag
      and drop colours to fill the asset, use any colours you want! <color=#FFA500>The
      only constraint will be that you shouldn't use the same colour next to each
      other!</color>"
